          <p>
            The process for counter-notifications is governed by Section 512(g) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act: http://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf. 
            If you believe that your material has been removed improperly, you may file a counter notification. To file an official counter notification with us, you 
            must provide a written communication that sets forth the items specified below. Please note that under Section 512(f) of the Copyright Act, any person who 
            knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification may be subject to liability. Please 
            also be advised that we enforce a policy that provides for the termination in appropriate circumstances of users who are repeat infringers. Accordingly, 
            if you are not sure whether certain material infringes the copyrights of others, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
